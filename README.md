Motif and Discord Detection using Matrix Profile analysis

The STUMPY library efficiently computes something called a matrix profile, a vector that stores the z-normalized Euclidean distance between any subsequence within a time series and its nearest neighbor.

To understand it, go through the above notebook which explains how to get that matrix profile via eucledian distance concept via stumpy library!!
