Motif and Discord Detection using Matrix Profile analysis

The STUMPY library efficiently computes something called a matrix profile, a vector that stores the z-normalized Euclidean distance between any subsequence within a time series and its nearest neighbor.

To understand it, go through the above notebook which explains how to get that matrix profile via eucledian distance concept via stumpy library!!

Sample can be found in the below links:
